🎓 Student Marks Analysis with NumPy
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use NumPy for data analysis by simulating and analyzing student marks. We generate a dataset of marks for 100 students across 5 subjects and perform various operations such as averages, identifying top performers, and analyzing subject difficulty.

This project is a beginner-friendly NumPy practice that covers array creation, aggregation, indexing, and statistical analysis.

🎯 Project Motivation

In real-world scenarios, educational institutions and data analysts often need to evaluate student performance at both the individual and subject levels. While Pandas is widely used for such analysis, NumPy provides a strong foundation for handling raw numerical data efficiently.

This project was built to:

Strengthen fundamentals of NumPy (array generation, reshaping, statistics).

Show how numerical insights can be extracted from synthetic datasets.

Serve as a portfolio project for aspiring Data Analysts to demonstrate skills in data wrangling, aggregation, and interpretation.

By starting with NumPy, one builds the logical foundation to later transition smoothly into Pandas and advanced analytics.
